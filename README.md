Developed an interactive dash-board for historic sales data of B2C (business-to-consumer) sales. Implemented unsupervised model for Profiling of Customers using python and built report on the clusters obtained in Power Bi. Analyzed, Explored, Performed statistical methods on features and combined multiple table. Imputation of missing values were performed. Tried to implement Dimension Reduction Techniques and retained 80% of variance explained by the model. Normalized the features within a particular range. Built a model using K-mean clustering with k=10 and the optimal value of K=7 is obtained and visualized using KElbowVisualizer. Quality check of the estimated with Silhouette score = 0.196.
